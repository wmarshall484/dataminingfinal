Comments to the author
======================

This paper presents a technological solution to the problem
of pick and place of (known) dynamic objects. The paper
details both the perception and the planning. Although it
is not a theoretic paper, it can be of interest for the
iros audience.

Some improvements can be incorporated:

-	The results obtained (pick and place each 6.7s with
obstacles moving at 33cm/s) say nothing by themselves. 
Some comments on the requirements need to be included, i.e.
if the robot is expected to work with humans, which is the
desired performance?   Comparison with other  similar
approaches is needed  (e.g. although industrial automation
applications are more structured, the knowledge of their
current performance is interesting ).

-	In the motion planning, the cost function used aims
to minimize the end-effector path length.  An explanation
is needed on how does this relate to requirements (stated
at the beginning of the section) for the robot to work
together with human workers (what does ”optimal” mean at
the end of page?). 

-	The analysis section should be more structured, the
important points should be more clearly highlighted and
some tables summarizing the results should be included to
facilitate the evaluation.
