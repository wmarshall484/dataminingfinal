A PR2 picks objects off of a conveyor belt moving at 33 cm/s, and drops the objects in boxes on either side of the robot. Objects from a known data set are recognized and localized on the belt surface to enable planning of grasp trajectories. An ARA* planner computes a collision-free arm trajectory to the most favorable grasp point in space and time.
